# First MLOPs


MLOps stands for Machine Learning Operations. MLOps is focused on streamlining the process of deploying machine learning models to production, and then maintaining and monitoring them. MLOps is a collaborative function, often consisting of data scientists, ML engineers, and DevOps engineers.

Why MLOps?


* Automation
* Scalability
* Reproducibility
* Monitoring
* Governance

A machine learning pipeline is a way to control and automate the workflow it takes to produce a machine learning model. Machine learning pipelines consist of multiple sequential steps that do everything from data extraction and preprocessing to model training and deployment.



        A Container is a type of software that packages up an application and all its dependencies so the application runs reliably from one computing environment to another.

        Docker is software used for building and managing containers.

        Kubernetes is an open-source system for managing containerized applications in a clustered environment.
