# First MLOPs


MLOps stands for Machine Learning Operations. MLOps is focused on streamlining the process of deploying machine learning models to production, and then maintaining and monitoring them. MLOps is a collaborative function, often consisting of data scientists, ML engineers, and DevOps engineers.

Why MLOps?


* Automation
* Scalability
* Reproducibility
* Monitoring
* Governance

A machine learning pipeline is a way to control and automate the workflow it takes to produce a machine learning model. Machine learning pipelines consist of multiple sequential steps that do everything from data extraction and preprocessing to model training and deployment.
